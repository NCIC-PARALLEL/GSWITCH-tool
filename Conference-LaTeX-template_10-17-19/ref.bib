Churchill, a balanced regional parallelization strategy, overcomes these challenges, fully automating the multiple steps required to go from raw sequencing reads to variant discovery. Through implementation of novel deterministic parallelization techniques, Churchill allows computationally efficient analysis of a high-depth whole genome sample in less than two hours.

	Abstract = {We have developed a tool for rapidly determining the number of exact matches of any word within large, internally repetitive genomes or sets of genomes. Thus we can readily annotate any sequence, including the entire human genome, with the counts of its constituent words. We create a Burrows-Wheeler transform of the genome, which together with auxiliary data structures facilitating counting, can reside in about one gigabyte of RAM. Our original interest was motivated by oligonucleotide probe design, and we describe a general protocol for defining unique hybridization probes. But our method also has applications for the analysis of genome structure and assembly. We demonstrate the identification of chromosome-specific repeats, and outline a general procedure for finding undiscovered repeats. We also illustrate the changing contents of the human genome assemblies by comparing the annotations built from different genome freezes.},

@techreport{Massie:EECS-2013-207,
	Abstract = {Current genomics data formats and processing pipelines are not designed to scale well to large datasets. The current Sequence/Binary Alignment/Map (SAM/BAM) formats were intended for single node processing. There have been attempts to adapt BAM to distributed computing environments, but they see limited scalability past eight nodes. Additionally, due to the lack of an explicit data schema, there are well known incompatibilities between libraries that implement SAM/BAM/Variant Call Format (VCF) data access.

To address these problems, we introduce ADAM, a set of formats, APIs, and processing stage implementations for genomic data. ADAM is fully open source under the Apache 2 license, and is implemented on top of Avro and Parquet for data storage. Our reference pipeline is implemented on top of Spark, a high performance in-memory map-reduce system. This combination provides the following advantages:

1) Avro provides explicit data schema access in C/C++/C#, Java/Scala, Python, php, and Ruby;
2) Parquet allows access by database systems like Impala and Shark; and
3) Spark improves performance through in-memory caching and reducing disk I/O.

In addition to improving the format's cross-platform portability, these changes lead to significant performance improvements. On a single node, we are able to speedup sort and duplicate marking by 2×. More importantly, on a 250 Gigabyte (GB) high (60×) coverage human genome, this system achieves a 50× speedup on a 100 node computing cluster (see Table 1), fulfilling the promise of scalability of ADAM.

The ADAM format provides explicit schemas for read and reference oriented (pileup) sequence data, variants, and genotypes. As the schemas are implemented in Apache Avro---a cross-platform/language serialization format---they eliminate the need for the development of language-specific libraries for format decoding/encoding, which eliminates the possibility of library incompatibilities.

A key feature of ADAM is that any application that implements the ADAM schema is compatible with ADAM. This is important, as it prevents applications from being locked into a specific tool or pattern. The ADAM stack is inspired by the ``narrow waist'' of the Internet Protocol (IP) suite (see Figure 2). We consider the explicit use of a schema in this format to be the greatest contribution of the ADAM stack.

In addition to the advantages outlined above, ADAM eliminates the file headers in modern genomics formats. All header information is available inside of each individual record. The variant and genotype formats also demonstrate two significant improvements. First, these formats are co-designed so that variant data can be seamlessly calculated from a given collection of sample genotypes. Secondly, these formats are designed to flexibly accommodate annotations without cluttering the core variant/genotype schema. In addition to the benefits described above, ADAM files are up to 25% smaller on disk than compressed BAM files without losing any information.

The ADAM processing pipeline uses Spark as a compute engine and Parquet for data access. Spark is an in-memory MapReduce framework which minimizes I/O accesses. We chose Parquet for data storage as it is an open-source columnar store that is designed for distribution across multiple computers with high compression. Additionally, Parquet sup- ports efficient methods (predicates and projections) for accessing only a specific segment or fields of a file, which can provide significant (2-10×) additional speedup for genomics data access patterns.},

The CLARITY Challenge was designed to spur convergence in methods for diagnosing genetic disease starting from clinical case history and genome sequencing data. DNA samples were obtained from three families with heritable genetic disorders and genomic sequence data were donated by sequencing platform vendors. The challenge was to analyze and interpret these data with the goals of identifying disease-causing variants and reporting the findings in a clinically useful format.

	Abstract = {While advances in genome sequencing technology make population-scale genomics a possibility, current approaches for analysis of these data rely upon parallelization strategies that have limited scalability, complex implementation and lack reproducibility. Churchill, a balanced regional parallelization strategy, overcomes these challenges, fully automating the multiple steps required to go from raw sequencing reads to variant discovery. Through implementation of novel deterministic parallelization techniques, Churchill allows computationally efficient analysis of a high-depth whole genome sample in less than two hours. The method is highly scalable, enabling full analysis of the 1000 Genomes raw sequence dataset in a week using cloud resources.                   http://churchill.nchri.org/                                  .},

@article{McKenna01092010,
	Abstract = {Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) projects, such as the 1000 Genomes Project, are already revolutionizing our understanding of genetic variation among individuals. However, the massive data sets generated by NGS---the 1000 Genome pilot alone includes nearly five terabases---make writing feature-rich, efficient, and robust analysis tools difficult for even computationally sophisticated individuals. Indeed, many professionals are limited in the scope and the ease with which they can answer scientific questions by the complexity of accessing and manipulating the data produced by these machines. Here, we discuss our Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a structured programming framework designed to ease the development of efficient and robust analysis tools for next-generation DNA sequencers using the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce. The GATK provides a small but rich set of data access patterns that encompass the majority of analysis tool needs. Separating specific analysis calculations from common data management infrastructure enables us to optimize the GATK framework for correctness, stability, and CPU and memory efficiency and to enable distributed and shared memory parallelization. We highlight the capabilities of the GATK by describing the implementation and application of robust, scale-tolerant tools like coverage calculators and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling. We conclude that the GATK programming framework enables developers and analysts to quickly and easily write efficient and robust NGS tools, many of which have already been incorporated into large-scale sequencing projects like the 1000 Genomes Project and The Cancer Genome Atlas.},
